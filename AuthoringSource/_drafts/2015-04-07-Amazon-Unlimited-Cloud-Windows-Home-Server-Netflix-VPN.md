## **Previously:**

* **Hardwares:** 
  * HP Proliant N54L + Windows Home Server 2011 + 3 x 1T hard drives  
* **Softwares:** 
  * [DrivePool](https://stablebit.com/)(For software RAID) + PS3 media server + Thunder(Download software)

* **Usages:** 
  * Server runs 24x7, Windows remote desktop into server everyday to download
  * [PS3 media server](http://www.ps3mediaserver.org/) and Windows Share stream the videos to other devices
  * Store all videos and pictures in RAID drive, about 200 GB
  * [PhotoSync](http://webecoz.com/) uploads images to Flickr for **1.** a second backup and **2.** easy viewing from everywhere
  * Google Drive 80GB $20 Per year plan with about 65% used.

## **Recently:**  

Made some moves

* Bought Amazon Unlimited Cloud Storage
* Bought Netflix Australia
* Bought [PrivateInternetAccess](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/)(PIA)
* Tuned off Windows home server

## **Data and Thinking**

**Problems with existing setup for backup**

* Upload of photos needs to be done manually every time for PhotoSync
* Flickr's iPhone app doesn't do auto-upload very well, this is quite important since it's much harder to organise photos taken by phones compare to by cameras(it's more time-frame/event related)
* Flickr's space is 1T, will run out one day
* The cost for running the server per year is some where between AUD$70 to AUD$170

**Problems with existing setup for watching movies and TVs**

* With Netflix Australia, there's too limited content, really want to keep it but can't find many shows to watch
* With home server I can watch latest shows but it needs manual operation every time something new is available

**New**

* Amazon Cloud's iPhone App does auto-upload pretty well and easy to navigate all old photos without taking too much space on the phones, the cost is only $59.99
* PIA with a deal atm is $59.95 for 2 years,  

## **Future Plans**

Will do the following

* Keep Amazon Cloud Storage
* Keep Windows Home Server off
* Keep PrivateInternetAccess
* Cancel Netflix
